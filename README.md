# Boulder Dash for the Oric by raspberrypioneer Jan 2025

# TODO for v1.0:
- Investigate about making game / timing a bit slower
- Investigate intro tune/music
- Perform a full test of all gameplay, all cave parameters, cave flow incl. bonus and levels
- Build and test other BD caves (Arno, BD2,3 and +1)

# Future considerations:
- Investigate DSK version
- Std + alt charsets are contiguous in memory - maybe one redef load for both? 
- Investigate - use different keys, remap? Test if swapping keys down with right is easier on Oric
- Investigate - can colours be applied to tiles, maybe inverse colour thing? Test normal/inverse colour
- Investigate - Joystick
- Consider adding 2 player, high score, demo mode

# Switching between Atmos and Oric-1
- main.s and keyboard.s: find and change below
`#define rom_v1_1 ; Using rom v1.1 (Atmos), comment this line out for rom v1.0 (Oric-1)`

- oricutron.cfg (part of osdk oricutron emulator): find and change below
`; Type of machine to emulate (atmos, oric1, oric1-16k, telestrat, pravetz)`
`machine = atmos`
`;machine = oric1`
