Boulder Dash for the Oric by raspberrypioneer Jan 2025

TODO for v1.0:
Investigate how sound works, add this into game
Investigate about making game / timing a bit slower
Perform a full test of all gameplay, all cave parameters, cave flow incl. bonus and levels
Build and test other BD caves (Arno, BD2,3 and +1)

Future considerations:
Investigate - Oric 1 and Atmos, TAP and DSK versions
Std + alt charsets are contiguous in memory - maybe one redef load for both? 
Investigate - use different keys, remap? Test if swapping keys down with right is easier on Oric
Investigate - can colours be applied to tiles, maybe inverse colour thing? Test normal/inverse colour
Investigate - Joystick
Consider adding 2 player, high score, demo mode
